	abstract = {The Text Encoding Initiative ({TEI}) Guidelines have long been regarded as the de facto standard for the preparation of digital textual resources in the scholarly research community. For the beginner, they offer a daunting range of possibilities, reflecting the huge range of potential applications for text encoding, from traditional scholarly editions, to language corpora, historical lexicons, digital archives and beyond.

Drawing on many examples of {TEI}-encoded text from a variety of research domains, this simple and straightforward book is intended to help the beginner make their own choices from the full range of {TEI} options.

It explains the {XML} technology used by the {TEI} in language accessible to the non-technical reader and provides a guided tour of the many parts of the {TEI} universe, and how it may be customized to suit an individual project’s needs.},

	abstract = {{TEI}, the Text Encoding Initiative, was founded in 1987 to develop guidelines for encoding machine-readable texts of interest to the humanities and social sciences. The {TEI} is a text-centric community of practice in the academic field of digital humanities, operating continuously since the 1980s. The community currently runs several mailing lists, holds an annual conference, and maintains an eponymous technical standard, an online journal, a wiki, a {GitHub} repository, and a toolchain. The {TEI} Guidelines, which collectively define an {XML} format, are the defining output of the community of practice. The format differs from other well-known open formats for text (such as {HTML} and {OpenDocument}) in that it’s main mission is for encoding “extant” texts such that they are amenable to scholarly processing. After a brief introduction to the {TEI}, we will discuss the mechanisms built in to the {TEI} for customization.},
